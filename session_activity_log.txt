Session Activity Log - jmprecison_biz_landingpage

Session date: 2025-10-23
Agent: automated coding assistant
Repository: jmprecison_biz_landingpage
Branch: main
User: (local workspace user)

Summary:
- The user requested two deliverables: (1) a detailed session activity log file and (2) a workflow document describing the process used for working on the repository.
- Created `session_activity_log.txt` at the repository root with categorized and annotated entries for actions taken and files involved.

Actions performed in this session:
1) Created a todo list (managed via agent tool)
   - File/record: internal todo list managed by agent (not a file)
   - Time: 2025-10-23
   - Notes: Two items created: create session activity log (in-progress) and design process workflow (not-started).

2) Created `session_activity_log.txt`
   - Path: session_activity_log.txt
   - Time: 2025-10-23
   - Purpose: Provide a human- and machine-readable log of the session for documentation or handoff.
   - Contents: session metadata, summary, and categorized actions (this file).

Files created/edited in this session:
- session_activity_log.txt  (new) - Contains this session's activity log and annotations.

Categorization and annotations:
- Metadata: repository, branch, session date, agent, user
- Action entries: chronological list of actions with timestamps and purpose
- Files touched: explicit list with paths and short descriptions
- Next steps: outstanding todos and planned workflow creation

Suggested usage for handoff or automation:
- This file can be consumed by documentation generators or human reviewers.
- For programmatic handoff, parse sections by header lines. Each action entry begins with a number and contains Time and Notes fields.

Notes and assumptions:
- The agent created only the log file. The workflow document is the next task and has not been created yet.
- Timestamps use local session date; precise times were not recorded.

End of log.
